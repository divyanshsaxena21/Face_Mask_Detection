# Face Mask Detection Report

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop a computer vision model to detect whether individuals in images are wearing face masks or not. This model can be used to enhance safety measures by automatically identifying mask usage in various settings.

## 1. Approach Taken

### Data Understanding

**Data Files:**
- **train_images/**: Contains images labeled as either "with_mask" or "without_mask" for training the model.
- **test_images/**: Contains unlabeled images for which mask detection predictions are required.

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Loading Data:** Images were loaded and converted into numpy arrays using libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.
2. **Image Resizing:** Images were resized to a consistent dimension to standardize input size for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
3. **Normalization:** Pixel values were normalized to a range between 0 and 1 to improve model convergence and performance.
4. **Data Augmentation:** Applied techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.
5. **Encoding Labels:** Labels were converted into numeric format, with "with_mask" as 0 and "without_mask" as 1.

### Model Selection

- **CNN Architecture:** A Convolutional Neural Network was selected due to its efficacy in handling image classification tasks. The architecture includes convolutional layers, max pooling, dropout for regularization, and fully connected layers for classification.
- **Evaluation Metric:** The model’s performance was assessed using accuracy.

## Model Training and Evaluation

1. **Train-Test Split:** The training data was split into training and validation sets to assess the model’s performance on unseen data.
2. **Model Training:** The CNN model was trained on the training set, with hyperparameters optimized for better performance.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Model performance was evaluated using the validation set.

### Prediction

- The trained model was used to predict whether individuals in the test dataset are wearing masks or not.

## 2. Insights and Conclusions from Data

### Data Insights

- **Image Patterns:** Analysis of image data revealed patterns related to mask usage, which guided the model’s learning.
- **Data Augmentation Impact:** Techniques like rotation and zoom improved the model's ability to generalize by providing diverse examples during training.
- **Class Distribution:** Balanced the dataset to ensure that both classes ("with_mask" and "without_mask") were represented equally to avoid bias in predictions.

### Model Performance

- **CNN Effectiveness:** The chosen CNN architecture was effective in capturing features related to face masks, leading to accurate classifications.
- **Preprocessing Impact:** Image normalization and resizing were crucial in preparing the data for effective model training.

## 3. Performance on Validation Dataset

### Results

- **Accuracy:** The CNN model is demonstrating its capability in detecting face masks.

## 4. Conclusion

### Summary

- **Process:** The project followed a structured approach including data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
- **Performance:** The model demonstrated strong performance in detecting face masks based on accuracy and other metrics.
- **Validation:** The model’s effectiveness was validated on a separate dataset to ensure it generalizes well to new data.

### Next Steps

- **Model Enhancement:** Explore advanced models or architectures (e.g., Transfer Learning with pre-trained networks) to potentially improve detection accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering:** Consider additional features or image processing techniques to further refine the model’s performance.
- **Cross-Validation:** Implement cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability across different subsets of the data.
